                    <Typography variant="body1" > Many restorative functions in the body kick in primarily during sleep,
                        like muscle growth, tissue repair protein synthesis and hormone release. The brain also builds
                        up adenosine, a by-product of cell activity, during the day. This is cleared away during sleep.

                    <Typography variant="h5" > Brain Plasticity Theory</Typography>
                    <Typography variant="body1" > Recent research findings suggest that the brain is actually very
                        active during sleep. During sleep, the brain processes the day's information and filters
                        what is important into long term memory. Metabolic waste in the brain is also cleaned out
                        at a greater rate than during the day.
                        Our project will hone in on this theory.
                        We will be looking specifically at studies on what goes on inside the brains of mice during sleep.
