                    <Typography variant="body1"> Many Research findings suggest that the brain is very
                        active during sleep, and that it is connected to changes in the layout and organization of the
                        Brain. During sleep, the brain processes the day's information and filters
                        what is important into long term memory. Infants require about 13 hours of sleep each night,
                        this being a significant age for brain development. Metabolic waste in the brain is also cleaned
                        out
                        at a greater rate than during the day.
                        Our project will hone in on this theory.
                        We will be looking specifically at studies on what goes on inside the brains of mice during
                        sleep.

                        fairly regular time (hopefully). Every cell in
                        our body is tuned to the planet relative to the Sun. The earth spins once every 24 hours on its
                        axis, so our Circadian Rhythm is about 24 hours.

                        When we wake up in the morning, 2 hormones are released by the adrenal glands, Cortisol and
                        Epinephrine. Cortisol makes you
                        alert and ready for the day. It also sets off a 10-12 hour timer for when melatonin will be
                        secreted. Melatonin is secreted from the pineal gland.

                        Adenosine, a neurotransmitter, and Melatonin, a hormone, signal to the brain that we need sleep.
                        Adenosine is a byproduct of the break down and usage of <a
                        href={"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#:~:text=Adenosine%20triphosphate%20(ATP)%20is%20an,condensate%20dissolution%2C%20and%20chemical%20synthesis."}>
                        ATP </a>. It builds up throughout the day, especially when we work out. When we sleep, Adenosine
                        is cleared from the brain. Caffeine
                        works as a stimulant by blocking adenosine receptors. There is a handful of people that have a
                        mutant adenosine receptor and can drink coffee before bed.
                        Light inhibits melatonin powerfully. Cells know it is night time when melatonin is released.
